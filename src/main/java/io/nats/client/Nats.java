/**
 * The Nats class is the entry point into the NATS client for Java. This class
 * is used to create a connection to the NATS server. Connecting is a
 * synchronous process, with a new asynchronous version available.
 * 
 * <p>Simple connections can be created with a URL, while more control is provided
 * when an {@link Options Options} object is used. There are a number of options that
 * effect every connection, as described in the {@link Options Options} documentation.
 * 
 * <p>At its simplest, you can connect to a nats-server on the local host using the default port with:
 * <pre>Connection nc = Nats.connect()</pre>
 * <p>and start sending or receiving messages immediately after that.
 * 
 * <p>While the simple case relies on a single URL, the options allows you to configure a list of servers
 * that is used at connect time and during reconnect scenarios.
 * 
 * <p>NATS supports TLS connections. This library relies on the standard SSLContext class to configure
 * SSL certificates and trust managers, as a result there are two steps to setting up a TLS connection,
 * configuring the SSL context and telling the library which one to use. Several options are provided
 * for each. To tell the library to connect with TLS:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Pass a tls:// URL to the connect method, or as part of the options. The library will use the 
 * default SSLContext for both the client certificates and trust managers.
 * <li>Call the {@link Options.Builder#secure() secure} method on the options builder, again the default
 * SSL Context is used.
 * <li>Call {@link Options.Builder#sslContext(javax.net.ssl.SSLContext) sslContext} when building your options.
 * Your context will be used.
 * <li>Pass an opentls:// url to the connect method, or in the options. The library will create a special
 * SSLContext that has no client certificates and trusts any server. <strong>This is less secure, but useful for
 * testing and behind a firewall.</strong>
 * <li>Call the {@link Options.Builder#opentls() opentls} method on the builder when creating your options, again
 * the all trusting, non-verifiable client is created.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>To set up the default context for tls:// or {@link Options.Builder#secure() secure} you can:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Configure the default using System properties, i.e. <em>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</em>.
 * <li>Set the context manually with the SSLContext setDefault method.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>If the server is configured to verify clients, the opentls mode will not work, and the other modes require a client certificate
 * to work.
 * 
 * <p>Authentication, if configured on the server, is managed via the Options as well. However, the url passed to {@link #connect(String) connect()}
 * can provide a user/password pair or a token using the forms: {@code nats://user:password@server:port} and {@code nats://token@server:port}.
 * 
 * <p>Regardless of the method used a {@link Connection Connection} object is created, and provides the methods for
 * sending, receiving and dispatching messages.
