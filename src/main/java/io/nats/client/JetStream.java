/**
 * JetStream context for access to streams and consumers in NATS.
 *
 * <h3>Basic usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>{@link #publish(String, byte[]) JetStream.Publish} will send a message on the specified subject, waiting for acknowledgement.
 * A  <b>503 No responders</b> error will be received if no stream is listening on said subject.
 *
 * <p>{@link #publishAsync(String, byte[]) PublishAsync} will not wait for acknowledgement but return a {@link CompletableFuture CompletableFuture},
 * which can be checked for acknowledgement at a later point.
 *
 * <p> Use {@link #getStreamContext(String ) getStreamContext(String)} to access a simplified API for <b>consuming/subscribing</b> messages from Jetstream.
 * It is <b>recommened</b> to manage consumers explicitly through {@link StreamContext StreamContext} or {@link JetStreamManagement JetStreamManagement}
 *
 * <p>{@link #subscribe(String)} is a convenience method for implicitly creating a consumer on a stream and receiving messages. This method should be used for ephemeral (not durable) conusmers.
 * It can create a named durable consumers though Options, but we prefer to avoid creating durable consumers implictly.
 * It is <b>recommened</b> to manage consumers explicitly through {@link StreamContext StreamContext} and {@link ConsumerContext ConsumerContext} or {@link JetStreamManagement JetStreamManagement}
 *
 *
 * <h3>Recommended usage for creating streams, consumers, publish and listen on a stream</h3>
 * <pre>
 *  io.nats.client.Connection nc = Nats.connect();
 *
 *  //Setting up a stream and a consumer
 *  JetStreamManagement jsm = nc.jetStreamManagement();
 *  StreamConfiguration sc = StreamConfiguration.builder()
 *    .name("my-stream")
 *    .storageType(StorageType.File)
 *    .subjects("foo.*", "bar.*")
 *    .build();
 *
 *  jsm.addStream(sc);
 *
 *  ConsumerConfiguration consumerConfig = ConsumerConfiguration.builder()
 *    .durable("my-consumer")
 *    .build();
 *
 *  jsm.createConsumer("my-stream", consumerConfig);
 *
 *  //Listening and publishing
 *  io.nats.client.JetStream js = nc.jetStream();
 *  ConsumerContext consumerContext = js.getConsumerContext("my-stream", "my-consumer");
 *  MessageConsumer mc = consumerContext.consume(
 *    msg -&gt; {
 *      System.out.println("   Received " + msg.getSubject());
 *      msg.ack();
 *    });
 *
 *  js.publish("foo.joe", "Hello World".getBytes());
 *
 *  //Wait a moment, then stop and close the MessageConsumer
 *  Thread.sleep(3000);
 *  mc.stop();   //Stops pull requests
 *  mc.close();  //Unsubcribes
 *
 *  </pre>
 *
 *	<h3>Recommended usage of asynchronous publishing</h3>
 *
 *  Jetstream messages can be published asynchronously, returning a CompletableFuture.
 *  Note that you need to check the Future eventually otherwise the delivery guarantee is the same a regular {@link Connection#publish(String, byte[]) Connection.Publish}
 *
 *  <p>We are publishing a batch of 100 messages and check for completion afterwards.
 *
 *  <pre>
 *  int COUNT = 100;
 *  java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture&lt;?&gt;[] acks = new java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture&lt;?&gt;[COUNT];
 *
 *  for( int i=0; i&lt;COUNT; i++ ) {
 *    acks[i] = js.publishAsync("foo.joe", ("Hello "+i).getBytes());
 *  }
 *
 *  //Acknowledgments may arrive out of sequence, but CompletableFuture is handling this for us.
 *  for( int i=0; i&lt;COUNT; i++ ) {
 *    try {
 *      acks[i].get();
 *    } catch ( Exception e ) {
 *      //Retry or handle error
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 *  //Now we may send anther batch
 *
 * </pre>
