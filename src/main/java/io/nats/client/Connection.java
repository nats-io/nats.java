/**
 * The Connection class is at the heart of the NATS Java client. Fundamentally a connection represents
 * a single network connection to the NATS server.
 * 
 * <p>Each connection you create will result in the creation of a single socket and several threads:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A reader thread for taking data off the socket
 * <li> A writer thread for putting data onto the socket
 * <li> A timer thread for a few maintenance timers
 * <li> A dispatch thread to handle request/reply traffic
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The connection has a {@link Connection.Status status} which can be checked using the {@link #getStatus() getStatus}
 * method or watched using a {@link ConnectionListener ConnectionListener}.
 * 
 * <p>Connections, by default, are configured to try to reconnect to the server if there is a network failure up to
 * {@link Options#DEFAULT_MAX_RECONNECT times}. You can configure this behavior in the {@link Options Options}.
 * Moreover, the options allows you to control whether reconnect happens in the same order every time, and the time
 * to wait if trying to reconnect to the same server over and over.
 * 
 * <p>The list of servers used for connecting is provided by the {@link Options Options}. The list of servers used
 * during reconnect can be an expanded list. This expansion comes from the connections most recent server. For example,
 * if you connect to serverA, it can tell the connection &quot;i know about serverB and serverC&quot;. If serverA goes down
 * the client library will try to connect to serverA, serverB and serverC. Now, if the library connects to serverB, it may tell the client 
 * &quot;i know about serverB and serverE&quot;. The client's list of servers, available from {@link #getServers() getServers()}
 * will now be serverA from the initial connect, serverB and serverE, the reference to serverC is lost.
 * 
 * <p>When a connection is {@link #close() closed} the thread and socket resources are cleaned up.
 * 
 * <p>All outgoing messages are sent through the connection object using one of the two 
 * {@link #publish(String, byte[]) publish} methods or the {@link #request(String, byte[]) request} method.
 * When publishing you can specify a reply to subject which can be retrieved by the receiver to respond.
 * The request method will handle this behavior itself, but it relies on getting the value out of a Future
 * so may be less flexible than publish with replyTo set.
 * 
 * <p>Messages can be received in two ways. You can create a Subscription which will allow you to read messages
 * synchronously using the {@link Subscription#nextMessage(Duration) nextMessage} method or you can create a 
 * {@link Dispatcher Dispatcher}. The Dispatcher will create a thread to listen for messages on one or more subscriptions.
 * The Dispatcher groups a set of subscriptions into a single listener thread that calls application code
 * for each messages.
 * 
 * <p>Applications can use the {@link #flush(Duration) flush} method to check that published messages have 
 * made it to the server. However, this method initiates a round trip to the server and waits for the response so
 * it should be used sparingly.
 * 
 * <p>The connection provides two listeners via the Options. The {@link ConnectionListener ConnectionListener}
 * can be used to listen for lifecycle events. This listener is required for
 *  {@link Nats#connectAsynchronously(Options, boolean) connectAsynchronously}, but otherwise optional. The
 * {@link ErrorListener ErrorListener} provides three callback opportunities including slow consumers, error
 * messages from the server and exceptions handled by the client library. These listeners can only be set at creation time
 * using the {@link Options options}.
 * 
 * <p><em>Note</em>: The publish methods take an array of bytes. These arrays <strong>will not be copied</strong>. This design choice
 * is based on the common case of strings or objects being converted to bytes. Once a client can be sure a message was received by
 * the NATS server it is theoretically possible to reuse that byte array, but this pattern should be treated as advanced and only used
 * after thorough testing.
